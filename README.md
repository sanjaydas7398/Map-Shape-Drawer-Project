Title -
Map-Shape-Drawer - A Tool for Drawing LineStrings and Polygons on Maps

Description - 
Map-Shape-Drawer is a web application that allows users to interactively draw LineStrings (paths) and Polygons (areas) on a map. It provides a simple interface for adding waypoints, connecting them with lines, and measuring distances. Additionally, it allows inserting polygons before or after any waypoint, enabling users to create complex geographic shapes.

Features -
Draw LineStrings and Polygons by clicking on the map.
Real-time updates of coordinates and distances as you draw.
Insert a Polygon before or after any waypoint in a LineString.
Automatically calculate distances between waypoints.
User-friendly UI with drawing tools and interactive map integration.
Completed shapes and routes are stored with their coordinates and distances for future use.
